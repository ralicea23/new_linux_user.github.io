      <description>Doom Emacs After hearing about Emacs for some time, I began using it last year. Initially, I hesitated due to its steep learning curve and the time investment it required. However, the challenge has been quite rewarding. Emacs has revolutionized my daily computer interactions. Although I used to rely heavily on the mouse, Emacs has shifted my workflow to be more keyboard-centric, enhancing my overall experience.
The standout feature for me is Org-mode, which has significantly improved my productivity.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is my first blog about Emacs, It has been quite a challenge for me like everything in Linux. Since I moved from Windows OS for good, I&amp;#39;ve experienced a lot of trouble on Linux. I started with Manjaro (a very bad choice to start experimenting) and it was a mess, it was 2016 and I hardly found documentation, tutorials or any help about Manjaro. The reason I choose Manjaro was about ego, looking information about Linux in YouTube in the first video I watched the guy was using Manjaro and said that Manjaro was for smart people and was bashing Ubuntu.</description>
